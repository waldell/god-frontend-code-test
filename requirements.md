Spent a total of 5 hours doing this task.
Things I would like to fix but didn't have time for is...
* Fix centering of the "Thumbnails"/dots when in mobile, now it's left aligned.
* Fix highlighting current item in the thumbnails/dots. The component I used didn't play well with me there!
* I really don't like the look of inline-styles. That could be fixed much neater!
* Fix the structure of the project. It's really just implemented right now and not cleaned up like I like it :)
* Breakup stuff into smaller portions like folders && files for models/types etc. etc.
* Probably some more stuff!
